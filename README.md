# math_py
given any polynomial this code parses polynomila into coefficients and exponenents 
and then plots graph for each range of x values entered. 
This code is written for code practice. A library may already be present doing similar.

Usage:
bash-3.2$  pyton polynomial_plot.py 
enter the equation (ax^n+bx+c) : x3-5x-4
enter new range (m,n , steps/points) : -5,5,1
enter new range (m,n , steps/points) : -50,50

bash-3.2$  pyton polynomial_plot.py 
enter the equation (ax^n+bx+c) : -2x3 + 5x^2 
enter new range (m,n , steps/points) : -2.5, 2.5

Notes: code uses matplotlib.pyplot
  pip install matplotlib
